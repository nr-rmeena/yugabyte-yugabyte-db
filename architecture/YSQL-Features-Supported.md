# What Features Does YSQL Support?

YSQL uses the query layer from **PostgreSQL v11.2**, and intends to support most PostgreSQL functionality on top of a distributed database. This document tracks what features are currently supported, and which ones are in the Roadmap.

> **Note**: This list is updated periodically but not always up-to-date. Please ask in our [community Slack chat](https://www.yugabyte.com/slack) if you have any questions about specifics or the latest state. We release software almost once a week, and features are rapidly getting added.
