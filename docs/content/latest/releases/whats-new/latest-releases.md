### Known Issues

#### Yugabyte Platform

*   Azure IaaS orchestration
    *   No pricing information provided (5624)
    *   No support for regions with zero Availability Zones(AZs) (5628)

#### Core Database

*   Advisory on clock-skew
    *   After commit `a60a4ae00d217563cac865b3363e2c2bb8aa58ba`, by default, any YB node will explicitly crash if it detects a clock skew higher than the `max_clock_skew` flag (default 500ms). This can be disabled by setting `fail_on_out_of_range_clock_skew=false`, but this could lead to consistency issues! The recommendation is that you ensure clocks are synchronized across your cluster.

### Docker

```

### New features

#### Yugabyte Platform

*   **Azure Cloud integration for Yugabyte Platform (in beta):** 

    [Yugabyte Platform is natively integrated with Azure cloud](http://blog.yugabyte.com/introducing-yugabyte-platform-on-azure-beta-release/) to simplify deploying, monitoring, and managing YugabyteDB deployments. This feature automates a number of operations including orchestration of instances, secure deployments, online software upgrades, and scheduled backups, as well as monitoring and alerting. (6094, 6020)

*   Yugabyte Platform operations now allow promoting a Yugabyte TServer only node to run Yugabyte Master and TServer process (5831)

#### Core Database

*   **Enhanced multi-region capabilities with geo-partitioning and follower reads**

    The YugabyteDB 2.5 release adds [row-level geo-partitioning capabilities](https://blog.yugabyte.com/geo-partitioning-of-data-in-yugabytedb/) as well as follower reads to the extensive set of multi-region features that YugabyteDB already had.

*   **Enterprise-grade security features:** 

    Authentication using the highly secure SCRAM-SHA-256 is now supported to limit security risks from brute force attacks and sniffing, including LDAP support for better user management and the ability to audit all database operations. 

*   **Table-level partitions** allow users to split what is logically one large table into smaller sub-tables, using the following types of table partitioning schemes that PostgreSQL supports: _range partitioning_, _list partitioning,_ and _hash partitioning_. Read more about [table partitioning in YugabyteDB](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/architecture/design/ysql-row-level-partitioning.md). 
*   **Event triggers** are now supported in addition to regular table-level triggers in YSQL. While regular triggers are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events. The event-based trigger framework enables detecting changes made to the data, and automating any subsequent tasks that need to be performed, which are useful in a number of use cases such as implementing a consolidated, central audit table (2379)
*   **Simplified cluster administration:** 
    *   **Online rebuild of indexes** is supported for both the YSQL and YCQL APIs. This means that new indexes can be added to tables with pre-existing data while concurrent updates are happening on the cluster. The online index rebuild  process creates the newly added index in the background, and transactionally enables the index once the rebuild of all the data is completed. This feature allows flexibility of adding indexes as the application needs evolve to keep queries efficient.
    *   **Cluster execution statistics and running queries** can be analyzed in detail, allowing administrators to gain insights into how the database is performing. The <code>[pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/pgstatstatements.html)</code> extension, which enables tracking execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by the cluster, is supported and enabled by default.  Support for <code>pg_stat_activity</code> has also been added, which shows information related to the activity performed by each connection. Yet another useful feature in this category is the ability to view all the live queries being executed by the cluster at any point in time.
    *   <strong>Detailed query plan and execution analysis </strong>can now be performed with commands such as <code>EXPLAIN</code> and <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>. These commands display the execution plan generated by the planner for a given SQL statement. The execution plan shows details for any SQL statement such as how tables will be scanned (plain sequential scan, index scan), what join algorithms will be used to fetch required rows from the different tables, etc.

### Improvements

## Notes

{{< note title="New release versioning" >}}

Starting with v2.2, Yugabyte release versions follow a [new release versioning convention](../../versioning). The latest release series, denoted by `MAJOR.ODD`, incrementally introduces new features and changes and is intended for development and testing only. Revision releases, denoted by `MAJOR.ODD.REVISION` versioning, can include new features and changes that might break backwards compatibility. For more information, see [Supported and planned releases](../../releases-overview).

{{< /note >}}

{{< note title="Upgrading from 1.3" >}}

Prior to v2.0, YSQL was still in beta. Upon release of v2.0, a backward-incompatible file format change was made for YSQL. For existing clusters running pre-2.0 release with YSQL enabled, you cannot upgrade to v2.0 or later. Instead, export your data from existing clusters and then import the data into a new cluster (v2.0 or later).
