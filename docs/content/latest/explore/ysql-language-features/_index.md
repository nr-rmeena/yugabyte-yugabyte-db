The YSQL API of YugabyteDB reuses a fork of the query layer of PostgreSQL as its starting point and runs on top of YugabyteDBâ€™s distributed storage layer called DocDB. This architectural decision allows YSQL to support most of the PostgreSQL features such as data types, queries, expressions, operators and functions, stored procedures, triggers, extensions, and so on, all of which are expected to work identically on both database systems.

{{< tip title="Tip" >}}
A large portion of the documentation and examples written for PostgreSQL would work against YSQL.

The following diagram demonstrates how the query layer of PostgreSQL is reused, specifically its components that receive the query (*postman*), the query *parser*, *rewriter*, *analyzer*, as well as components responsible for *planning* and *executing* the query. Some of these components have been modified to perform efficiently in a distributed SQL database.

## PostgreSQL Features in YSQL

The following table lists the most important YSQL features which you would find familiar if you have worked with PostgreSQL.

## What's Extra in YSQL?

Since YugabyteDB is a distributed SQL database, there is a number of features that are availale in YSQL yet not present in PostgreSQL, as summarized in the following table.

| YSQL Feature                                                 | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <span style="font-size:16px">Data distribution with `HASH`</span> | Enables the use of `HASH` sort order, in addition to `ASC` and `DESC` for indexes |
| <span style="font-size:16px">`TABLESPACES` for geographic placement</span> | Enables pinning of data in tables and table partitions to different geographic locations |
| <span style="font-size:16px">`TABLEGROUPS` for colocating tables</span> | Enables colocation of multiple smaller tables into one tablet for better performance |
