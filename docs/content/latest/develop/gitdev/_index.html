Developer experience and onboarding is a space that is getting simplified every day in different forms and shapes. Though the prevalence of vcs driven development, 12-factor, cloud-native, etc. exists,  dev onboarding is still challenging. Developers have to install tools, sometimes have to run some services locally, etc. as part of the development workflow. They often hit roadblocks like access issues, permission issues, resource constraints, etc. The experience is never been smooth. To that end, GitHub Codespaces and Gitpod steer developers to have a better experience by providing a git-driven fully automated, integrated cloud-native dev workflow. Like GitOps, GitDev is for application developers. This is like a "development environment as code & config" that seamlessly provides a pre-configured, consistent, instant development environment for stream-aligned teams.
