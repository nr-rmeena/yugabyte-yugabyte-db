Debezium is an open-source distributed platform used to capture the changes in a database.

## Get the Debezium connector for YugabyteDB

### Pull the connector from Docker

Using Docker, get the connector from Quay:

```sh
docker pull quay.io/yugabyte/debezium-connector:1.1-beta
```

### Build the Debezium connector on your own

In case you want to build the connector image yourself, follow the steps listed on the [README for debezium-connector-yugabytedb](https://github.com/yugabyte/debezium/blob/final-connector-ybdb/debezium-connector-yugabytedb2/README.md).

## Run Debezium locally

Follow the steps in this section to run CDC with Debezium on a local YugabyteDB cluster.

1. Start Zookeeper.

    ```sh
    docker run -it --rm --name zookeeper -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888 debezium/zookeeper:1.6
    ```

1. Start Kafka.

    ```sh
    docker run -it --rm --name kafka -p 9092:9092 --link zookeeper:zookeeper debezium/kafka:1.6
    ```

1. Assign your computer's IP address to an environment variable.

    ```sh
    # macOS:
    export IP=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0)

    # Linux:
    export IP=$(hostname -i)
    ```

1. Start a cluster using yugabyted. Note that you need to run yugabyted with the IP of your machine; otherwise, it would consider localhost (which would be mapped to the docker host instead of your machine).

    ```sh
    ./bin/yugabyted start --listen $IP
    ```

1. Connect using ysqlsh and create a table:

    ```sh
    ./bin/ysqlsh -h $IP
    ```

    ```sql
    create table test (id int primary key, name text, days_worked bigint);
    ```

### Create a database stream ID

[`yb-admin`](../../../admin/yb-admin#change-data-capture-cdc-commands) is equipped with the commands to manage stream IDs for Change Data Capture. Use it to create a stream ID:

```sh
./bin/yb-admin --master_addresses ${IP}:7100 create_change_data_stream ysql.yugabyte
```

```output
CDC Stream ID: d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3
```

### Start Debezium

Launch the connector:

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  --name connect -p 8083:8083 -e GROUP_ID=1 \
  -e CONFIG_STORAGE_TOPIC=my_connect_configs \
  -e OFFSET_STORAGE_TOPIC=my_connect_offsets \
  -e STATUS_STORAGE_TOPIC=my_connect_statuses \
  --link zookeeper:zookeeper --link kafka:kafka \
  quay.io/yugabyte/debezium-connector:1.1-beta
```

Deploy the configuration for the connector:

```bash
curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
  localhost:8083/connectors/ \
  -d '{
  "name": "ybconnector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.yugabytedb.YugabyteDBConnector",
    "database.hostname":"'$IP'",
    "database.port":"5433",
    "database.master.addresses": "'$IP':7100",
    "database.user": "yugabyte",
    "database.password": "yugabyte",
    "database.dbname" : "yugabyte",
    "database.server.name": "dbserver1",
    "table.include.list":"public.test",
    "database.streamid":"d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3",
    "snapshot.mode":"never"
  }
}'
```

### Configuration options

| Property | Default value | Description |
| :------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| connector.class | N/A | Specifies the connector to use to connect Debezium to the database. For YugabyteDB, use `io.debezium.connector.yugabytedb.YugabyteDBConnector`. |
| database.hostname | N/A | The IP address of the database host machine. For a distributed cluster, use the leader node's IP address. |
| database.port | N/A | The port at which the YSQL process is running. |
| database.master.addresses | N/A | Comma-separated list of `host:port` values. |
| database.user | N/A | The user which will be used to connect to the database. |
| database.password | N/A | Password for the given user. |
| database.dbname | N/A | The database from which to stream. |
| database.server.name | N/A | Logical name that identifies and provides a namespace for the particular YugabyteDB database server or cluster for which Debezium is capturing changes. This name must be unique, since it's also used to form the Kafka topic. |
| database.streamid | N/A | Stream ID created using yb-admin for Change Data Capture. |
| table.include.list | N/A | Comma-separated list of table names and schema names, such as `public.test` or `test_schema.test_table_name`. |
| snapshot.mode | N/A | `never` - Don't take a snapshot <br/><br/> `initial` - Take a snapshot when the connector is first started <br/><br/> `always` - Always take a snapshot <br/><br/> |
| table.max.num.tablets | 10 | Maximum number of tablets the connector can poll for. This should be greater than or equal to the number of tablets the table is split into. |
| cdc.poll.interval.ms | 200 | The interval at which the connector will poll the database for the changes. |
| admin.operation.timeout.ms | 60000 | Specifies the timeout for the admin operations to complete. |
| operation.timeout.ms | 60000 | |
| socket.read.timeout.ms | 60000 | |
| decimal.handling.mode | double | The `precise` mode is not currently supported. <br/><br/>  `double` maps all the numeric, double, and money types as Java double values (FLOAT64) <br/><br/>  `string` represents the numeric, double, and money types as their string-formatted form <br/><br/> |
| binary.handling.mode | hex | `hex` is the only supported mode. All binary strings are converted to their respective hex format and emitted as their string representation . |
| database.sslmode | disable | Whether to use an encrypted connection to the YugabyteDB cluster. Supported options are:<br/><br/> `disable` uses an unencrypted connection <br/><br/> `require` uses an encrypted connection and fails if it can't be established <br/><br/> `verify-ca` uses an encrypted connection, verifies the server TLS certificate against the configured Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, and fails if no valid matching CA certificates are found <br/><br/>  `verify-full` behaves like verify-ca, but also verifies that the server certificate matches the host to which the connector is trying to connect. |
| database.sslrootcert | N/A | The path to the file which contains the root certificate against which the server is to be validated. |
| database.sslcert | N/A | Path to the file containing the client's SSL certificate. |
| database.sslkey | N/A | Path to the file containing the client's private key. |

### Start a Kafka Topic console consumer (optional)

```sh
docker run -it --rm --name consumer --link zookeeper:zookeeper --link kafka:kafka debezium/kafka:1.6 \
watch-topic -a dbserver1.public.test
```
