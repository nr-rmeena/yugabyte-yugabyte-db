Yugabyte Cloud is a fully managed YugabyteDB-as-a-Service that allows you to run YugabyteDB clusters on public cloud providers such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The Yugabyte Cloud architecture is secure by default, using encryption in transit, encryption at rest, limited network exposure, authentication, and role-based access control for authorization to protect clusters and communication between clients and databases.

Yugabyte Cloud uses a shared responsibility model, where security and compliance is a shared responsibility between public cloud providers, Yugabyte, and Yugabyte Cloud customers.
