Use alerts to notify you and your team members when cluster and database resource use exceeds predefined limits, or of potential billing issues.

Alerts and notifications are configured and managed on the **Alerts** page.

To monitor clusters in real time, use the Performance Metrics on the cluster [Overview and Performance](../overview/) tabs.

## Features

- Yugabyte Cloud sends email notifications to all cloud account members.

- When an alert is triggered, the email notification is sent once, regardless of how long the condition lasts.

- When an alert is triggered, the notification is displayed on the **Notifications** page, where it remains until the condition that caused the alert is resolved. When the alert condition is resolved, the notification is dismissed automatically.

- Alerts are enabled for all clusters in your cloud.

- Alerts can have two severity levels: Warning or Severe.

## Configure alerts

Enable alerts for your cloud using the **Configurations** tab on the **Alerts** page.

Only cloud admin users can configure billing alerts.

To view alert details, select the alert to display the **Alert Policy Settings** sheet.

To change an alert, click the toggle in the **Status** column, or on the **Alert Policy Settings** sheet.

To test that you can receive email from the Yugabyte server, click **Send Test Email**.

## Review notifications

Open notifications are listed on the **Notifications** tab on the **Alerts** page.

When the condition that caused the alert resolves, the notification is dismissed automatically.

## Fixing alerts

Alerts can be triggered for issues with a particular cluster, or for billing issues.

### Cluster alerts

When you receive a cluster alert, the first step is to review the chart for the metric over time to evaluate trends and monitor your progress. The following charts are available:

| Alert | Chart |
| :--- | :--- |
| Node CPU Utilization | CPU Usage |
| Node Free Storage | Disk Usage |
| Cluster Queues Overflow | RPC Queue Size |
| Compaction Overload | Compaction |

You can view the metrics on the cluster **Performance** tab. Refer to [Performance metrics](../overview/#performance-metrics).

If you are getting frequent cluster alerts on a free cluster, you may have reached the performance limits for free clusters. Consider upgrading to a standard cluster.

#### Fix storage alerts

A notification is sent if the free storage on any node in the cluster falls below the threshold, as follows:

- Node free storage is below 40% (Warning).
- Node free storage is below 25% (Severe).

Once disk capacity falls below 25% for any node, look at your database for unused tables that you can truncate or drop.

Consider increasing the disk space per node. By default, you are entitled to 50GB per vCPU. Adding vCPUs also automatically increases disk space.

For information on scaling clusters, refer to [Scale and configure clusters](../../cloud-clusters/configure-clusters/).

#### Fix CPU alerts

A notification is sent if CPU use on any node in the cluster exceeds the threshold, as follows:

- Node CPU use exceeds 70% on average for at least 5 minutes (Warning).
- Node CPU use exceeds 90% on average for at least 5 minutes (Severe).

If your cluster experiences frequent spikes in CPU use, consider optimizing your workload.

Unoptimized queries can lead to CPU alerts. Use the [Slow Queries](../cloud-queries-slow/) and [Live Queries](../cloud-queries-live/) views to identify potentially problematic queries, then use the EXPLAIN statement to see the query execution plan and identify optimizations. Consider adding one or more indexes to improve query performance. For more information, refer to [Analyzing Queries with EXPLAIN](../../../explore/query-1-performance/explain-analyze/).

High CPU use could also indicate a problem and may require debugging by Yugabyte Support.

If CPU use is continuously higher than 80%, your workload may also have exceeded the capacity of your cluster. Consider scaling your cluster by adding vCPUs. Refer to [Scale and configure clusters](../../cloud-clusters/configure-clusters/).

#### Fix database overload alerts

A notification is sent for the following database overload alert:

- Cluster queues overflow and/or compaction overload.
<!-- Cluster exceeds 200 simultaneous YSQL connections.-->

This alert is triggered if any one of the following conditions occurs:

- The number of client requests that timed out while waiting in the service queue is greater than 0 for 10 minutes. This can be caused by your application generating requests (such as queries and scans) at a rate faster than the database can process them.
- The number of client requests that were dropped because the service queue was full is greater than 0 for 10 minutes. This can be caused by your application generating requests (such as queries and scans) at a rate faster than the database can process them.
- The number of compaction requests that were rejected is greater than 0 for 10 minutes. This can be caused by running a high INSERT/ UPDATE/ DELETE workload on a cluster that is undersized.

Cluster queue overflow and compaction overload are indicators of the incoming traffic and system load. If the backends get overloaded, requests pile up in the queues. When the queue is full, the system responds with backpressure errors. This can cause performance degradation.

If your cluster is generating this alert, you may need to rate limit your queries. Look at optimizing the application generating the requests in the following ways:

- Examine the application retry logic, and reduce total retry count.
- Increase client request timeout at the driver layer.
- Reduce query parallelism.
- If needed, set the driver execution to "sync" rather than "async" to serialize queries.

If your cluster is generating this alert and isnâ€™t under a very large workload, contact [Yugabyte Support](https://support.yugabyte.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360003113431).

### Billing alerts

Billing alerts can trigger for the following events:

| Alert | Response |
| :--- | :--- |
| Credit card expiring within 3 months | Add a new credit card. |
| Invoice payment failure | Check with your card issuer to ensure that your card is still valid and has not exceeded its limit. Alternatively, you can add another credit card to your billing profile. |
| Credit point usage exceeds the 50%, 75%, and 90% limit | Add a credit card to your billing profile, or contact Yugabyte Support. |

For information on adding credit cards and managing your billing profile, refer to [Manage your billing profile and payment method](../../cloud-admin/cloud-billing-profile/).
