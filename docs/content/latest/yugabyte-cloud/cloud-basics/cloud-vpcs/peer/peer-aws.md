Before you can peer with an AWS application VPC, you must have created at least one VPC in Yugabyte Cloud that uses AWS.

You need the following details for the AWS application VPC you are peering with:

- Account ID
- VPC ID
- VPC region
- VPC CIDR address

To obtain these details, navigate to your AWS [Your VPCs](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#vpcs) page for the region hosting the VPC you want to peer.

To create a peering connection, in Yugabyte Cloud do the following:

1. On the **Network Access** page, select **VPC Network**, then **Peering Connections**.
1. Click **Add Peering Connection** to display the **Create Peering** sheet.
1. Enter a name for the peering connection.
1. Choose **AWS**.
1. Choose the Yugabyte Cloud VPC you are peering. Only VPCs that use AWS are listed.
1. Enter the AWS account ID, and the application VPC ID, region, and CIDR address.
1. Click **Initiate Peering**.

The peering connection is created with a status of _Pending_. To complete the peering, you must accept the peering request in your AWS account.

### Accept the peering request in AWS

To complete a _Pending_ peering connection, you need to sign in to AWS, accept the peering request, and add a routing table entry.

You'll need the CIDR address of the Yugabyte Cloud VPC you are peering with. You can view and copy this in the **VPC Details** sheet on the **VPCs** page or the **Peering Details** sheet on the **Peering Connections** page.

After you sign in to your AWS account, navigate to the region hosting the VPC you want to peer.

#### DNS settings

Before accepting the request, ensure that the DNS hostnames and DNS resolution options are enabled for the VPC. This ensures that the cluster's hostnames in standard connection strings automatically resolve to private instead of public IP addresses when the Yugabyte Cloud cluster is accessed from the application VPC. To set DNS settings:

1. On the AWS [Your VPCs](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#vpcs) page, select the VPC in the list.
1. Click **Actions** and choose **Edit DNS hostnames** or **Edit DNS resolution**.
1. Enable the **DNS hostnames** or **DNS resolution** option and click **Save changes**.

#### Accept the peering request

To accept the peering request, do the following:

1. On the AWS [Peering Connections](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#PeeringConnections) page, select the VPC in the list; its status is Pending request.
1. Click **Actions** and choose **Accept request** to display the **Accept VPC peering connection request** window.

1. Click **Accept request**.

Note the Peering connection ID; you will use it when adding the routing table entry.

#### Add the routing table entry

To add a routing table entry:

1. On the AWS [Route Tables](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#RouteTables) page, select the route table associated with the VPC peer.
1. Click **Actions** and choose **Edit routes** to display the **Edit routes** window.
    ![Add routes in AWS](/images/yb-cloud/cloud-peer-aws-route.png)
1. Click **Add route**.
1. Add the Yugabyte Cloud cluster CIDR address to the **Destination** column, and the Peering connection ID to the **Target** column.
1. Click **Save changes**.

When finished, the status of the peering connection in Yugabyte Cloud changes to _Active_ if the connection is successful.
