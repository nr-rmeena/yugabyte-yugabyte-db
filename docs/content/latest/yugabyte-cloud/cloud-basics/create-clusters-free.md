Use a free cluster to get started with YugabyteDB. Although not suitable for production workloads, a free cluster includes enough resources to start exploring the core features available for developing applications with YugabyteDB.

## Features

Your free cluster includes the following:

- Single node.
- Up to 2 vCPUs and 10 GB of storage, depending on the cloud provider.
- An [edge release](../../cloud-faq/#what-version-of-yugabytedb-does-my-cluster-run-on) of YugabyteDB, which provides early access to new features.
- Available in all [regions](../../release-notes#cloud-provider-regions).

Share your feedback, questions, and suggestions with other users on the [YugabyteDB Community Slack](https://www.yugabyte.com/slack).

## Limitations

- Limit of one free cluster per account.
- Free clusters can't be scaled.
- No support for VPC networking.
- No backups.
- Free clusters that are inactive for 21 days are [paused](../../cloud-faq/#why-is-my-free-cluster-paused); after 30 days they are deleted.

## Creating a free cluster

To create a free cluster, on the **Clusters** page, click **Add Cluster** to start the **Create Cluster** wizard.

The **Create Cluster** wizard has the following pages:

1. [Select Cluster Type](#select-cluster-type)
1. [Cluster Settings](#cluster-settings)
1. [Database Admin Credentials](#database-admin-credentials)

### Select Cluster Type

![Add Cluster Wizard - Select Type](/images/yb-cloud/cloud-addcluster1-type.png)

Select **Yugabyte Cloud Free** and click **Next** to display the **Cluster Settings** page.

### Cluster Settings

![Add Cluster Wizard - Cluster Settings](/images/yb-cloud/cloud-addcluster-paid2.png)

Set the following options:

- **Provider**: Choose a cloud provider - AWS or GCP.
- **Cluster Name**: Enter a name for the cluster.
- **Region**: Choose the Region where the cluster will be located.

### Database Admin Credentials

The admin credentials are required to connect to the YugabyteDB database that is installed on the cluster. (You can [add additional users](../../cloud-secure-clusters/add-users/) after the cluster is provisioned.)

![Add Cluster Wizard - Admin Settings](/images/yb-cloud/cloud-addcluster-admin.png)

You can use the default credentials generated by Yugabyte Cloud, or add your own.

Download the credentials, and click **Create Cluster**.

{{< warning title="Important" >}}

Save your database credentials in a safe place. If you lose these credentials, you won't be able to use the database.

{{< /warning >}}

## Viewing the cluster

After you complete the wizard, the **Clusters** page appears, showing the provisioning of your new cluster in progress.

When the cluster is ready, the cluster [Overview](../../cloud-monitor/overview/) tab is displayed.

You now have a fully configured YugabyteDB cluster provisioned in Yugabyte Cloud with the database admin credentials you specified.

## Next steps

- [Assign IP allow lists](../../cloud-secure-clusters/add-connections/)
- [Connect to your cluster](../../cloud-connect/)
- [Add database users](../../cloud-secure-clusters/add-users/)
- [Develop applications](../../cloud-develop/)
- [Database authorization in Yugabyte Cloud clusters](../../cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-users/)
