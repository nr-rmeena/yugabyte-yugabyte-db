## Early access release - September 8, 2021

### Limitations

The Yugabyte Cloud early access release provides access to free clusters only. Paid clusters coming soon.

### Known issues

- **Cloud Shell** - No support for Firefox.
- **Cloud Shell** - The cloud shell cannot display a greater number of lines of output than the page size. For example, if you run a query that returns more rows than there are lines of output in the current browser view, the results will not display.
