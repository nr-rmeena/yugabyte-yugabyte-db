## YugabyteDB

### What is YugabyteDB

YugabyteDB is a high-performant, highly available and scalable distributed SQL database designed for powering global, internet-scale applications. It is fully compatabile with [PostgreSQL] and provides strong [ACID](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#acid) guarantees for distributed transactions. It can be deployed in a single region, multi-region, and multi-cloud setups. YugabyteDB is developed and distributed as an [Apache 2.0 open source project](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/).

### When is YugabyteDB a good fit?

YugabyteDB is a good fit for fast-growing, cloud native applications that need to serve business-critical data reliably, with zero data loss, high availability, and low latency. Common use cases include:

- Distributed Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) applications needing multi-region scalability without compromising strong consistency and low latency. For example, user identity, Retail product catalog, Financial data service.

- Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP), also known as Translytical, applications needing real-time analytics on transactional data. For example, user personalization, fraud detection, machine learning.

- Streaming applications needing to efficiently ingest, analyze, and store ever-growing data. For example, IoT sensor analytics, time series metrics, real-time monitoring.

### When is YugabyteDB not a good fit?

YugabyteDB is not a good fit for traditional Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) use cases that need complete ad-hoc analytics. Use an OLAP store such as [Druid](http://druid.io/druid.html) or a data warehouse such as [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.net/).

### What is a YugabyteDB universe

A YugabyteDB [universe](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#universe) comprises one [primary cluster](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#primary-cluster) and zero or more [read replica clusters](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#read-replica-cluster) that collectively function as a resilient and scalable distributed database. It is common to have just a primary cluster and hence the terms cluster and universe are sometimes used interchangeably but it is worthwhile to note that they are different.

### Are there any performance benchmarks available?

YugabyteDB is benchmarked on a regular basis on a variety of standard benchmarks like [TPC-C](/preview/benchmark/tpcc/), [YCSB](/preview/benchmark/ycsb-ysql/) and [sysbench](/preview/benchmark/sysbench-ysql/).

{{<lead link="/preview/benchmark/">}}
To see the current benchmark results and  understand how to run various benchmarks yourself, see [Benchmark](/preview/benchmark/)
{{</lead>}}

### How is YugabyteDB tested for correctness

Apart from the rigorous failure testing, YugabyteDB passes most of the scenarios in [Jepsen](https://jepsen.io/) testing which is a methodology and toolset used to verify the correctness of distributed systems, particularly in the context of consistency models and fault tolerance. It was developed by Kyle Kingsbury (aka "aphyr") and has become a standard for stress-testing distributed databases, data stores, and other distributed systems.

## PostgreSQL support

### How compatible is YugabyteDB with PostgreSQL

YugabyteDB is [wire-protocol, syntax, feature and runtime](https://www.yugabyte.com/postgresql/postgresql-compatibility/) compatible with PostgreSQL. But that said, supporting all PostgreSQL features in a distributed system is not always feasible.

{{<lead link="/preview/explore/ysql-language-features/postgresql-compatibility/#unsupported-postgresql-features">}}
For the list of PostgreSQL features not supported or currently being worked on, see [Unsupported PostgreSQL features](/preview/explore/ysql-language-features/postgresql-compatibility/#unsupported-postgresql-features)
{{</lead>}}

### Can I use my existing PostgreSQL tools and drivers with YugabyteDB

Yes. YuagbyteDB is [fully compatible](#how-compatible-is-yugabytedb-with-postgresql) with Postgresql. So it automatically works well with most of the PostgreSQL tools.

{{<lead link="">}}
To learn more about how to get standard tools work with YugabyteDB, see [Integrations](/preview/integrations/tools/)
{{</lead>}}

### Are PostgreSQL extensions supported

Extensions are very useful as they extend the functionality of the core database by providing new data types and functionalites. Given the distributed nature of YugabyteDB not all Postgresql extensions are supported by default, but YugabyteDB pre-bundles many of the popular extensions and these should be readily available on your cluster.

{{<lead link="/preview/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/">}}
For the list of extensions supported, see [PostgreSQL extensions](/preview/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/)
{{</lead>}}

### How can I migrate from PostgreSQL

YugabyteDB is fully compatible with Postgres and hence most PostgreSQL applications should work as is. But to address corner cases, we have published a [comprehensive guide](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/manage/data-migration/migrate-from-postgres/) to help you migrate from PostgreSQL.

## Architecture

### How does YugabyteDB distribute data

The table data is split into [tablets](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#tablet) and the table rows are mapped to the tablets via [sharding](/preview/explore/linear-scalability/data-distribution/). The tablets themselves are distributed across the various nodes in the cluster.

{{<lead link="/preview/explore/linear-scalability/data-distribution/">}}
To understand how data is distributed in detail, see [Data distribution](/preview/explore/linear-scalability/data-distribution/)
{{</lead>}}

### How does YugabyteDB scale

YugabyteDB scales seamlessly when new nodes are added to the cluster without any service disruption. Table data is [stored distributed](#how-does-yugabytedb-distribute-data) in tablets. When new nodes are added, the rebalancer moves certain tablets to other nodes and keeps the no.of tablets on each node more or less the same. As data grows, these tablets also split into two and are moved to other nodes.

{{<lead link="/preview/explore/linear-scalability/">}}
To understand in detail how scaling works, see [Horizontal scalability](/preview/explore/linear-scalability/)
{{</lead>}}

### How does YugabyteDB provide high availability

YugabyteDB replicates [tablet](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#tablet) data onto [followers](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#tablet-follower) of the tablet via [RAFT](/preview/architecture/docdb-replication/raft/) consensus. This ensures that a consistent copy of the data is available in case of failures. On failures, one of the tablet followers is promoted to be the [leader](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#tablet-leader).

{{<lead link="/preview/explore/fault-tolerance/">}}
To understand how YugabyteDB survives node, zone, rack and region failures, see [Resiliency and high availability](/preview/explore/fault-tolerance/)
{{</lead>}}

### How is data consistency maintained across multiple nodes

Every write (insert, update, delete) to the data is replicated via [RAFT](/preview/architecture/docdb-replication/raft/) consensus to [tablet followers](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#tablet-follower) as per the [replication factor(RF)]((/stable/architecture/key-concepts/#replication-factor-rf) of the cluster. Before acknowledging the write operation back to the client, YugabyteDB ensures that the data is replicated to a quorum (RF/2 + 1) followers.

{{<lead link="(/stable/architecture/docdb-replication/replication/#replication-factor">}}
To understand how data is replicated, see [Synchronous replication](/stable/architecture/docdb-replication/replication/#replication-factor)
{{</lead>}}

### What is tablet splitting

Data is stored in [tablets](/preview/architecture/key-concepts/#tablet). As the tablet grows, the tablet splits into two. This enables some data to be moved to other nodes in the cluster.

{{<lead link="">}}
To understand how tablet splitting works in detail, see [Tablet splitting](/preview/architecture/docdb-sharding/tablet-splitting/)
{{</lead>}}

### How can YugabyteDB be both CP and ensure high availability at the same time?

In terms of the [CAP theorem](https://www.yugabyte.com/blog/a-for-apple-b-for-ball-c-for-cap-theorem-8e9b78600e6d), YugabyteDB is a consistent and partition-tolerant (CP) database. It ensures high availability (HA) for most practical situations even while remaining strongly consistent. While this may seem to be a violation of the CAP theorem, that is not the case. CAP treats availability as a binary option whereas YugabyteDB treats availability as a percentage that can be tuned to achieve high write availability (reads are always available as long as a single node is available).
