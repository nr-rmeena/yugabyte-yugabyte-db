Use a free cluster to get started with YugabyteDB. Although not suitable for production workloads, a free cluster includes enough resources to start exploring the core features available for developing applications with YugabyteDB.

## Features

Your free cluster includes the following:

- Single node.
- Up to 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, and 10 GB of storage, depending on the cloud provider.
- An [edge release](../../cloud-faq/#what-version-of-yugabytedb-does-my-cluster-run-on) of YugabyteDB, which provides early access to new features.
- Available in all [regions](../../release-notes#cloud-provider-regions).

Share your feedback, questions, and suggestions with other users on the [YugabyteDB Community Slack]({{<slack-invite>}}).

## Creating a free cluster

To create a free cluster, on the **Clusters** page, click **Add Cluster** to start the **Create Cluster** wizard.

The **Create Cluster** wizard has the following pages:

1. [Select Cluster Type](#select-cluster-type)
1. [Cluster Settings](#cluster-settings)
1. [Database Admin Credentials](#database-admin-credentials)

### Select Cluster Type

![Add Cluster Wizard - Select Type](/images/yb-cloud/cloud-addcluster1-type.png)

Select **YugabyteDB Managed Free** and click **Next** to display the **Cluster Settings** page.

### Cluster Settings

![Add Cluster Wizard - Cluster Settings](/images/yb-cloud/cloud-addcluster-free2.png)

Set the following options:

- **Provider**: Choose a cloud provider - AWS or GCP.
- **Cluster Name**: Enter a name for the cluster.
- **Region**: Choose the Region where the cluster will be located.

### Database Admin Credentials

The admin credentials are required to connect to the YugabyteDB database that is installed on the cluster.

You can use the default credentials generated by YugabyteDB Managed, or add your own.

For security reasons, the admin user does not have YSQL superuser privileges, but does have sufficient privileges for most tasks. For more information on database roles and privileges in YugabyteDB Managed, refer to [Database authorization in YugabyteDB Managed clusters](../../cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-users/).

After the cluster is provisioned, you can [add more users and change your password](../../cloud-secure-clusters/add-users/).

![Add Cluster Wizard - Admin Settings](/images/yb-cloud/cloud-addcluster-admin.png)

Download the credentials, and click **Create Cluster**.

{{< warning title="Important" >}}

Save your database credentials. If you lose them, you won't be able to use the database.

{{< /warning >}}

## Viewing the cluster

After you complete the wizard, the **Clusters** page appears, showing the provisioning of your new cluster in progress.

When the cluster is ready, the cluster [Overview](../../cloud-monitor/overview/) tab is displayed.

You now have a fully configured YugabyteDB cluster provisioned in YugabyteDB Managed with the database admin credentials you specified.

## Inactive free clusters

Free clusters are paused after 21 days of inactivity. When a cluster is paused, you receive an email notification. You need to resume the paused cluster before you can perform any operations on it. If you don't resume your cluster, a second notification is sent after 28 days of inactivity, notifying you that the cluster will be deleted in 48 hours.

To resume your paused cluster, sign in to YugabyteDB Managed, select the cluster on the **Clusters** page, and click **Resume**.

Free clusters are deleted after 30 days of inactivity. Only paused clusters are deleted. YugabyteDB Managed runs idle cluster deletion jobs daily, so your cluster may be paused or deleted any time up to 24 hours after the time mentioned in the notification email.

To keep your cluster from being paused, you (or, where applicable, an application connected to the database) can perform any of the following actions:

- Any SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE database operation.

- Create or delete tables.

- Add or remove IP allow lists.

## Limitations

- Limit of one free cluster per account.
- Free clusters can't be scaled.
- Free clusters are secured by limiting network access using IP allow lists. VPC networking is not supported.
- No backups.
- You can't change the maintenance window schedule, set exclusion periods, or delay cluster maintenance for free clusters.
- You can't pause free clusters.
- Free clusters have the following resource limitations:
  - Up to 10 simultaneous connections; more than that will result in increased latencies and dropped connections.
  - Maximum 500 tables or 12.5 million objects.

YugabyteDB is a distributed database optimized for deployment across multiple nodes. Because free clusters are single node, they are not suitable for proof-of-concept (POC) or performance testing. To evaluate YugabyteDB Managed for production use or conduct a POC, contact {{<support-cloud>}}.

## Next steps

- [Assign IP allow lists](../../cloud-secure-clusters/add-connections/)
- [Connect to your cluster](../../cloud-connect/)
- [Add database users](../../cloud-secure-clusters/add-users/)
- [Build an application](../../cloud-quickstart/cloud-build-apps/)
- [Database authorization in YugabyteDB Managed clusters](../../cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-users/)
