After [creating a Sandbox cluster](../qs-add/), the easiest way to connect to it is to use Cloud Shell.

Using Cloud Shell, you can connect to your YugabyteDB Managed cluster from your browser, and interact with it using distributed SQL.

The shell has a one hour connection limit. If your session is idle for more than 5 minutes, it may disconnect. If your session expires, close your browser tab and connect again.

## Connect to your cluster using Cloud Shell

To connect to your cluster, do the following:

![Connect using cloud shell](/images/yb-cloud/cloud-connect-shell.gif)

1. On the **Clusters** page, ensure your cluster is selected.

1. Click **Connect** to display the **Connect to Cluster** dialog.

1. Under **Cloud Shell**, click **Launch Cloud Shell**.

1. Enter the database name (`yugabyte`), the user name (`admin`), select the YSQL API type, and click **Confirm**.

    Cloud Shell opens in a separate browser window. Cloud Shell can take up to 30 seconds to be ready.

    ```output
    Enter your DB password:
    ```

1. Enter the password for the admin user credentials that you saved when you created the cluster.\
\
    The shell prompt appears and is ready to use.

    ```output
    ysqlsh (11.2-YB-2.2.0.0-b0)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    yugabyte=>
    ```

The command line interface (CLI) being used is called ysqlsh. ysqlsh is the CLI for interacting with YugabyteDB using the PostgreSQL-compatible YSQL API.

Cloud Shell also supports ycqlsh, a CLI for the YCQL API.

### Learn more

For more information on the ysqlsh and ycqlsh CLIs, refer to [ysqlsh](../../../admin/ysqlsh/) and [ycqlsh](../../../admin/ycqlsh/).

For more information on the YSQL and YCQL APIs, refer to [YSQL API](../../../api/ysql/) and [YCQL API](../../../api/ycql/).

For information on other ways to connect to your cluster, refer to [Connect to clusters](../../cloud-connect).
