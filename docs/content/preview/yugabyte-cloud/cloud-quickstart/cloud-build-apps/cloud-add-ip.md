In addition to having a [cluster deployed in YugabyteDB Managed](../../qs-add/), you need the following to run the sample applications with YugabyteDB Managed:

- **The cluster CA certificate**. YugabyteDB Managed uses TLS 1.2 for communicating with clusters, and digital certificates to verify the identity of clusters. The cluster CA certificate is used to verify the identity of the cluster when you connect to it from an application or client.
- **Your computer added to the cluster IP allow list**. Access to YugabyteDB Managed clusters is limited to IP addresses that you explicitly allow using IP allow lists. To enable applications to connect to your cluster, you need to add your computer's IP address to the cluster IP allow list.

1. Click **YugabyteDB Client Shell** or **Connect to your Application**.
1. Click **Download CA Cert** to download the cluster `root.crt` certificate to your computer.

## Add your computer to the cluster IP allow list

To add your computer to the cluster IP allow list:
