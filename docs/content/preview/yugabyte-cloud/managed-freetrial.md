Our team will contact you inside two business days.

Once applied, the credits can be used to create dedicated clusters in a [variety of topologies](../cloud-basics/create-clusters-topology/), including:

- Single region multi zone
- Replicated across regions
- Partition by region
- Read replicas

In the meantime, [create a Sandbox cluster](../cloud-basics/create-clusters/create-clusters-free/) to run a tutorial and [explore](../../explore/) YugabyteDB and distributed SQL.

Only one free trial can be applied to an account. You must use your credits within 30 days of creating your first dedicated cluster.
