Assuming [this repository][repo] is checked out in `~/code/yugabyte-db`, do the following:

```sh
cd ~/code/yugabyte-db
./yb_build.sh release
```

The command above will build the release configuration, add the binaries into the `build/release-<compiler>-dynamic-ninja` directory, and create a `build/latest` symlink to that directory.

If you see errors, such as `internal compiler error: Killed`, the system has probably run out of memory.
Try again by running the build script with less concurrency, for example, `-j1`.
