CentOS 7 is the recommended Linux development and production platform for YugabyteDB.

{{< /note >}}

## Install necessary packages

Update packages on your system, install development tools and additional packages:

```sh
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools'
sudo yum -y install epel-release git libatomic libicu rsync
```

### Python 3

Python 3.7 or higher is required.
Since CentOS 7 does not include that in the package manager, this is nontrivial.
One way is to get it is to compile from source.
Here is an example using Python 3.9.

[Install packages for building python][python-packages].

```
sudo yum -y install gcc make zlib-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel readline-devel sqlite sqlite-devel openssl-devel tk-devel libffi-devel xz-devel
```

[python-packages]: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment

Download python source.

```sh
cd /tmp
curl https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.16/Python-3.9.16.tgz | tar xz
cd Python-3.9.16
```

Make and install python to `/usr/local/bin`.

```sh
./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make altinstall
```

Create a symlink named `python3`.
It is wise to choose to install it somewhere besides `/usr/bin` and with higher precedence because the package manager's Python 3.6 may overwrite the symlink.
One such location is `/usr/local/bin`.

```sh
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3.9 /usr/local/bin/python3
```

{{< note title="Note" >}}

If encountering python-related issues during build, it may be that you are still using the previous build's virtualenv.
That virtualenv can be cleaned using the `--clean-venv` build option.

{{< /note >}}

### Cmake 3

Cmake 3.17.3 or higher is required.
The package manager has that, but we still need to link the name `cmake` to `cmake3`.
Do similarly for `ctest`.

```sh
sudo yum install -y cmake3
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/local/bin/cmake
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ctest3 /usr/local/bin/ctest
```

### /opt/yb-build

By default, when running build, thirdparty libraries are not built, and pre-built libraries are downloaded.
We also use [Linuxbrew](https://github.com/linuxbrew/brew) to provide some of the third-party dependencies on CentOS.
The build scripts automatically install these in directories under `/opt/yb-build`.
In order for the build script to write under those directories, it needs proper permissions.
One way to do that is as follows:

```sh
sudo mkdir /opt/yb-build
sudo chown $(whoami) /opt/yb-build
```

Alternatively, the build options `--no-download-thirdparty` and/or `--no-linuxbrew` can be specified.
However, those cases may require additional, undocumented steps.

### Ninja (optional)

It is recommended to use [Ninja][ninja] for faster build.

```sh
sudo yum install -y ninja-build
```

[ninja]: https://ninja-build.org

### Ccache (optional)

It is recommended to use [Ccache][ccache] for faster build.

```sh
sudo yum install -y ccache
```

Set `YB_CCACHE_DIR` in your `.bashrc` or equivalent:

```sh
# You may also want to add the following line to your .bashrc or equivalent.
export YB_CCACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/yb_ccache"
```

[ccache]: https://ccache.dev

### Java

{{% readfile "includes/java.md" %}}

The JDK requirement can be satisfied by the package manager.

```sh
sudo yum install -y java-11-openjdk
```

Maven can be downloaded/installed manually.
For example,

```sh
mkdir ~/tools
cd ~/tools
curl 'https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.0/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.0-bin.tar.gz' | tar xz
# You may also want to add the following line to your .bashrc or equivalent.
export PATH="$HOME/tools/apache-maven-3.9.0/bin:$PATH"
```

## Build the code

{{% readfile "includes/build-the-code.md" %}}

### Build release package (optional)

Additional packages are needed in order to build yugabyted-ui:

```sh
sudo yum install -y npm golang
```

ulimits may need to be modified.
For example, build may fail with "too many open files".
In that case, increase the nofile limit in `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

```
* - nofile 1048576
```

Start a new shell session, and check the limit increase with `ulimit -n`.

Run the `yb_release` script to build a release package:

```output.sh
$ ./yb_release
......
2023-02-10 23:19:46,459 [yb_release.py:299 INFO] Generated a package at '/home/user/code/yugabyte-db/build/yugabyte-2.17.2.0-44b735cc69998d068d561f4b6f337b318fbc2424-release-clang15-centos-x86_64.tar.gz'
```
