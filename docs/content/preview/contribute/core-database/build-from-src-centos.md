## Install necessary packages

Update packages on your system, install development tools and additional packages:

```sh
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools'
sudo yum install -y centos-release-scl epel-release git libatomic rsync which
```

### Python 3

Python 3.7 or higher is required.
The following example installs Python 3.8.

```sh
sudo yum -y install rh-python38
# Also add the following line to your .bashrc or equivalent.
source /opt/rh/rh-python38/enable
```

### CMake 3

[CMake][cmake] 3.17.3 or higher is required.
The package manager has that, but we still need to link the name `cmake` to `cmake3`.
Do similarly for `ctest`.

```sh
sudo yum install -y cmake3
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/local/bin/cmake
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ctest3 /usr/local/bin/ctest
```

[cmake]: https://cmake.org

### /opt/yb-build

By default, when running build, third-party libraries are not built, and pre-built libraries are downloaded.
We also use [Linuxbrew][linuxbrew] to provide some of the third-party dependencies on CentOS.
The build scripts automatically install these in directories under `/opt/yb-build`.
In order for the build script to write under those directories, it needs proper permissions.
One way to do that is as follows:

```sh
sudo mkdir /opt/yb-build
sudo chown "$(whoami)" /opt/yb-build
```

Alternatively, specify the build options `--no-download-thirdparty` and/or `--no-linuxbrew`.
Note that those options may require additional, undocumented steps.

### Ninja (optional)

Use [Ninja][ninja] for faster builds.

```sh
sudo yum install -y ninja-build
```

[ninja]: https://ninja-build.org

### Ccache (optional)

Use [Ccache][ccache] for faster builds.

```sh
sudo yum install -y ccache
# Also add the following line to your .bashrc or equivalent.
export YB_CCACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/yb_ccache"
```

[ccache]: https://ccache.dev

### GCC (optional)

To compile with GCC, install the following packages, and adjust the version numbers to match the GCC version you plan to use.

```sh
sudo yum install -y devtoolset-11 devtoolset-11-libatomic-devel
```

### Java

{{% readfile "includes/java.md" %}}

Both requirements can be satisfied by the package manager.

```sh
sudo yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk rh-maven35
# Also add the following line to your .bashrc or equivalent.
source /opt/rh/rh-maven35/enable
```

## Build the code

{{% readfile "includes/build-the-code.md" %}}

### Build release package (optional)

Install the following additional packages to build yugabyted-ui:

```sh
sudo yum install -y npm golang
```

The build may fail with "too many open files".
In that case, increase the nofile limit in `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

```sh
echo '* - nofile 1048576' | sudo tee -a /etc/security/limits.conf
```

Start a new shell session, and check the limit increase with `ulimit -n`.

Run the `yb_release` script to build a release package:

```output.sh
$ ./yb_release
......
2023-02-10 23:19:46,459 [yb_release.py:299 INFO] Generated a package at '/home/user/code/yugabyte-db/build/yugabyte-2.17.2.0-44b735cc69998d068d561f4b6f337b318fbc2424-release-clang15-centos-x86_64.tar.gz'
```
