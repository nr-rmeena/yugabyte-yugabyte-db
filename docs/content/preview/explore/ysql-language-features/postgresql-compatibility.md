YugabyteDB is a [PostgreSQL-compatible](https://www.yugabyte.com/tech/postgres-compatibility/) distributed database that supports the majority of PostgreSQL syntax. This means that existing applications built on PostgreSQL can often be migrated to YugabyteDB without changing application code.

Because YugabyteDB is PostgreSQL compatible, it works with the majority of PostgreSQL database tools such as various language drivers, ORM tools, schema migration tools, and many more third-party database tools.

## PostgreSQL parity

PostgreSQL parity is shorthand for two concepts:

- Feature compatibility

    Compatibility refers to whether YugabyteDB supports all the features of PostgreSQL and behaves as PostgreSQL does. With full PostgreSQL compatibility, youÂ should be able to take an application running on PostgreSQL and run it on YugabyteDB without any code changes. The application will run without any errors, but it may not perform well because of the distributed nature of YugabyteDB.

- Performance parity

    Performance parity refers to the capabilities of YugabyteDB that allow applications running on PostgreSQL to run with predictable performance on YugabyteDB. In other words, the performance degradation experienced by small and medium scale applications going from a single server database to a distributed database should be predictable and bounded.

### Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode

To test and take advantage of features developed for PostgreSQL parity in YugabyteDB that are currently in {{<badge/ea>}}, you can turn on Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode. When this mode is turned on, YugabyteDB is configured to use all the latest features developed for feature and performance parity.

After turning this mode on, as you upgrade universes, YugabyteDB will automatically enable new {{<badge/ea>}} PostgreSQL compatibility features. As features included in the PostgreSQL compatibility mode transition from {{<badge/ea>}} to {{<badge/ga>}} in subsequent versions of YugabyteDB, they become enabled by default on new universes, and are no longer managed under Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode.

Depending on the version of YugabyteDB, this flag enables different early access features as described in the following table.

| YugabyteDB Version | Feature | Flag |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2024.1 | Read-Committed isolation mode | yb_enable_read_committed_isolation=true |
|        | Wait-on-Conflict concurrency mode for predictable P99 latencies | |
|        | Cost based optimizer. Takes advantage of the distributed storage layer architecture and includes query pushdowns, LSM indexes, and batched nested loop joins to offer PostgreSQL-like performance. | yb_enable_base_scans_cost_model=true<br>yb_bnl_batch_size=1024<br>yb_fetch_row_limit=0<br>yb_fetch_size_limit=1MB |
|        | Use range sharding (ascending) by default | yb_use_hash_splitting_by_default=false |

{{<note title="Note">}}
If you have set these features independent of Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode, you cannot use Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode.

Conversely, if you are using Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode on a universe, you cannot set any of the features independently.
{{</note>}}

### Enable enhanced compatibility mode

#### YugabyteDB

To enable compatibility mode in YugabyteDB:

- Pass the `enable_pg_parity_early_access` flag to yugabyted when bringing up your cluster.

For example, from your YugabyteDB home directory, run the following command:

```sh
./bin/yugabyted start --enable_pg_parity_early_access
```

Note: When enabling the cost models, ensure that packed row for colocated tables is enabled by setting the `--ysql_enable_packed_row_for_colocated_table` flag to true.

#### YugabyteDB Anywhere

To enable compatibility mode in YugabyteDB Anywhere:

- When creating a universe, turn on the **Enable Enhanced Postgres Compatibility** option.

You can also change the setting on deployed universes using the **More > Edit Postgres Compatibility** option.

#### YugabyteDB Aeon

To enable compatibility mode in YugabyteDB Aeon:

- When creating a cluster, turn on the **Enable Enhanced Postgres Compatibility** option.

You can also change the setting on the **Settings** tab for deployed clusters.

## Unsupported PostgreSQL features

Because YugabyteDB is a distributed database, supporting all PostgreSQL features in a distributed system is not always feasible. This section documents the known list of differences between PostgreSQL and YugabyteDB. You need to consider these differences while porting an existing application to YugabyteDB.

The following PostgreSQL features are not supported in YugabyteDB:
