[DocDB](../../../architecture/docdb/), YugabyteDBâ€™s underlying distributed document store, uses a heavily customized version of RocksDB for node-local persistence. It has been engineered ground up to deliver high performance at a massive scale. Several features have been built into DocDB to support this design goal, like:

- Scan Resistant Global Block Cache
- Bloom/Index Data Splitting
- Global Memstore Limit
- Separate compaction queues to reduce read amplification
- Smart load-balancing across disks

These features enable YugabyteDB to handle massive datasets with ease. Let us go through the scenario of loading `1 billion` rows into a 3`-node cluster and look at the performance metrics.

## 1 Billion rows

In this experiment, we use the [YCSB benchmark](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki) with the standard JDBC binding to load 1 billion rows. We expected the dataset at the end of the data load to cross `1TB` on each node (or a `3TB` total data set size in each cluster).

## Configuration and Cluster setup

|                 |                        |
| --------------: | :--------------------- |
|          Region | AWS us-west-2          |
|         Release | v2.1.5                 |
|             API | YSQL                   |
|           Nodes | 3                      |
|    Machine Type | c5.4xlarge             |
|         Storage | 2 x 5TB SSDs (gp2 EBS) |
|        Sharding | Range and Hash         |
| Isolation level | Snapshot               |

## Results at a glance

`1B` row data load completed successfully for YSQL (using a range-sharded table) in about 26 hours. The following graphs show the throughput and average latency for the range-sharded load phase of the YCSB benchmark during the load phase.

The total dataset was `3.2TB` across the two nodes. Each node had just over `1TB` of data.
