Yugabyte CDCSDK Server is an open source project that provides a streaming platform for change data capture from YugabyteDB. The server is based on [Debezium](https://github.com/yugabyte/cdcsdk-server/blob/main/debezium.io). CDCSDK Server uses [debezium-yugabytedb-connector](https://github.com/yugabyte/debezium-connector-yugabytedb) to capture change events. It supports a YugabyteDB instance as a source and supports the following sinks:
* Kafka
* HTTP REST Endpoint
* AWS S3

## Basic Architecture

### Engine

A [Debezium Engine](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.9/development/engine.html) implementation is the unit of work. It implements a pipeline consisting of a source, sink, and simple transforms. The only supported source is YugabyteDB. The source is assigned a set of tablets that is polled at a configurable interval. An engineâ€™s workflow is as follows:
* Connect to the CDCSDK stream.
* Get a list of tables and filter based on the include list.
* Get and record a list of tablets.
* Poll tablets in sequence every polling interval.

### Server

A Debezium Engine is hosted within the CDCSDK server. The implementation is based on the [Debezium Server](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.9/operations/debezium-server.html). It uses the Quarkus framework and extensions to provide a server shell, metrics and alerts. By default, a server runs one Engine implementation within a thread. A server can also run in multi-threaded mode wherein multiple engines are assigned to a thread each. The server splits tablets into groups in a deterministic manner. Each group of tablets is assigned to an Engine.

## Quick Start

### Create a CDCSDK stream in YugabyteDB
Use [yb-admin](../../admin/yb-admin/#createchangedatastream) to create a CDC stream. A successful operation returns an output with the stream ID, make note of it to be used in further steps. For example:

```output
CDC Stream ID: d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3
```

### Download and run CDCSDK Server

CDCSDK Server distribution archives are available in [Github Releases](https://github.com/yugabyte/cdcsdk-server/releases) of the project. Each of the releases has a tar.gz labelled as CDCSDK Server.

The archive has the following layout:

```output
cdcsdk-server
  |-- conf
  |-- debezium-server-<CDCSDK-VERSION>.Final-runner.jar
  |-- lib
  |-- run.sh
```

### Unpack and run instructions

```sh
export CDCSDK_VERSION=<x.y.z>
wget https://github.com/yugabyte/cdcsdk-server/releases/download/v${CDCSDK_VERSION}/cdcsdk-server-dist-${CDCSDK_VERSION}.tar.gz

tar xvf cdcsdk-server-dist-${CDCSDK_VERSION}.tar.gz
cd cdcsdk-server

# Configure the application. More details in the next section
touch conf/application.properties

# Run the application
./run.sh
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `conf/application.properties`. There are multiple sections configured:
* `cdcsdk.source`: is for source connector configuration. Each instance of Debezium Server runs exactly one connector.
* `cdcsdk.sink` is for the sink system configuration.
* `cdcsdk.format` is for the output serialization format configuration.
* `cdcsdk.transforms` is for the configuration of message transformations.

### Apache Kafka

```properties
cdcsdk.sink.type=kafka
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.key.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
cdcsdk.source.connector.class=io.debezium.connector.yugabytedb.YugabyteDBConnector
cdcsdk.source.database.hostname=127.0.0.1
cdcsdk.source.database.port=5433
cdcsdk.source.database.user=yugabyte
cdcsdk.source.database.password=yugabyte
cdcsdk.source.database.dbname=yugabyte
cdcsdk.source.database.server.name=dbserver1
cdcsdk.source.database.streamid=de362081fa864e94b35fcac6005e7cd9
cdcsdk.source.table.include.list=public.test
cdcsdk.source.database.master.addresses=127.0.0.1:7100
cdcsdk.source.snapshot.mode=never
```

#### Confluent Cloud

If you are using a Confluent Cloud deployment of Kafka, you will need to add the following configuration:

```properties
cdcsdk.sink.type=kafka
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.bootstrap.servers=<BOOTSTRAP-SERVERS>
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.key.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
cdcsdk.source.connector.class=io.debezium.connector.yugabytedb.YugabyteDBConnector
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.security.protocol=SASL_SSL
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule   required username='USERNAME'   password='PASSWORD';
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.sasl.mechanism=PLAIN

cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.security.protocol=SASL_SSL
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule   required username='USERNAME'   password='PASSWORD';
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.producer.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=https

cdcsdk.sink.kafka.client.dns.lookup=use_all_dns_ips
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.session.timeout.ms=45000
cdcsdk.sink.kafka.acks=all

cdcsdk.source.database.hostname=127.0.0.1
cdcsdk.source.database.port=5433
cdcsdk.source.database.user=yugabyte
cdcsdk.source.database.password=yugabyte
cdcsdk.source.database.dbname=yugabyte
cdcsdk.source.database.server.name=dbserver1
cdcsdk.source.database.streamid=9d0079d5f5e74ea59989f37eb6358ea5
cdcsdk.source.table.include.list=public.test
cdcsdk.source.database.master.addresses=127.0.0.1:7100
cdcsdk.source.snapshot.mode=never
```

The `cdcsdk.source` configurations are nothing but the Debezium Connector's configurations only where you can specify the `cdcsdk.source` as a prefix to any of the connector's configurations. For a complete list of the Debezium configurations, see [Debezium Connector for YugabyteDB configurations](../change-data-capture/debezium-connector-yugabytedb/#connector-configuration-properties).

### Configuring using environment variables

Configuration using environment variables maybe useful when running in containers. The rule of thumb is to convert the keys to UPPER CASE and replace `.` with `_`. For example, `cdcsdk.source.database.port` has to be changed to `CDCSDK_SOURCE_DATABASE_PORT`.

### Server configuration

| Property | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `cdcsdk.server.transforms` | | Transformations to apply. | <!-- TODO: add the complete list of transforms available -->

**Additional configuration:**
| Property | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `quarkus.http.port` | 8080 | The port on which CDCSDK Server exposes Microprofile Health endpoint and other exposed status information. |
| `quarkus.log.level` | INFO | The default log level for every log category. |
| `quarkus.log.console.json` | true | Determine whether to enable the JSON console formatting extension, which disables "normal" console formatting. | 


### HTTP Client

The HTTP Client will stream changes to any HTTP Server for additional processing with the original design goal to make Debezium act as a native event source.

| Property | Default | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `cdcsdk.sink.type` | | Must be set to `http` |
| `cdcsdk.sink.http.url` | | The HTTP Server URL to stream events to. This can also be set by defining the K_SINK environment variable, which is used by the Knative source framework. |
| `cdcsdk.sink.http.timeout.ms` | 60000 | The number of milli-seconds to wait for a response from the server before timing out. |

### Amazon S3

The Amazon S3 Sink streams changes to an AWS S3 bucket. Only Inserts are supported. The available configuration options are:

| Property | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `cdcsdk.sink.type` | | Must be set to `s3`. |
| `cdcsdk.sink.s3.bucket.name` | | Name of S3 bucket. |
| `cdcsdk.sink.s3.region` | | Name of the region of the S3 bucket. |
| `cdcsdk.sink.s3.basedir` | | Base directory or path where the data has to be stored. |
| `cdcsdk.sink.s3.pattern` | | Pattern to generate paths (sub-directory and filename) for data files. |
| `cdcsdk.sink.s3.flushBytesMB` | 200 | Trigger Data File Rollover on file size. |
| `cdcsdk.sink.s3.flushRecords` | 10000 | Trigger Data File Rolloever on number of records |

{{< note title="Note" >}}

Amazon S3 Sink supports a single table at a time. Specifically `cdcsdk.source.table.include.list` should contain only one table at a time. If multiple tables need to be exported to Amazon S3, multiple CDCSDK servers that read from the same CDC Stream ID but write to different S3 locations should be setup.

{{< /note >}}

### Mapping records to S3 objects

The Amazon S3 Sink only supports [create events](../change-data-capture/debezium-connector-yugabytedb.md#create-events) in the CDC Stream. It writes `payload.after` fields to a file in S3.

The filename in S3 is generated as `${cdcsdk.sink.s3.basedir}/${cdcsdk.sink.s3.pattern}`. Pattern can contain placeholders to customize the filenames. It supports the following placeholders:

* {YEAR}: Year in which the sync was writing the output data in.
* {MONTH}: Month in which the sync was writing the output data in.
* {DAY}: Day in which the sync was writing the output data in.
* {HOUR}: Hour in which the sync was writing the output data in.
* {MINUTE}: Minute in which the sync was writing the output data in.
* {SECOND}: Second in which the sync was writing the output data in.
* {MILLISECOND}: Millisecond in which the sync was writing the output data in.
* {EPOCH}: Milliseconds since Epoch in which the sync was writing the output data in.
* {UUID}: Random uuid string

For example, the following pattern can be used to create hourly partitions with multiple files each of which are no greater than 200MB:

```output
{YEAR}-{MONTH}-{DAY}-{HOUR}/data-{UUID}.jsonl
```

#### IAM Policy

The AWS user account accessing the S3 bucket must have the following permissions:

* ListAllMyBuckets
* ListBucket
* GetBucketLocation
* PutObject
* GetObject
* AbortMultipartUpload
* ListMultipartUploadParts
* ListBucketMultipartUploads

Copy the following JSON to create the IAM policy for the user account. Change to a real bucket name. For more information, see Create and attach a policy to an IAM user.

Note: This is the IAM policy for the user account and not a bucket policy.

```json
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
     {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
           "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::*"
     },
     {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:GetBucketLocation"
         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>"
     },
     {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
           "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
           "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"

         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
     }
   ]
}
```

## Record structure

By default, the YugabyteDB connector generates a [complex record](../change-data-capture/debezium-connector-yugabytedb.md#data-change-events) in JSON with key and value information including payload. A sophisticated sink can use the information to generate appropriate commands in the receiving system.

Simple sinks expect simple key/value JSON object where key is the column name and value is the contents of the column. For simple sinks, set `cdcsdk.server.transforms=FLATTEN`. With this configuration, the record structure will only emit the payload as a simple JSON.

With `FLATTEN`, the following simple format is emitted:

```output
{
  "id":...,
  "first_name":...,
  "last_name":...,
  "email":...
}
```

## Operations

### Topology

* A universe can have multiple namespaces.
* Each namespace can have multiple CDCSDK streams.
* Each CDCSDK stream can have multiple servers associated with it. Default is 1. The group of multiple servers associated with a stream is called a ServerSet.

### Networking

A CDCSDK Server requires access to open ports in YugabyteDB. Therefore it has to run in the same VPC (or peered VPC) as the YugabyteDB database. The server also requires access to sinks in the case of Kafka or an HTTP REST Endpoint and the appropriate credentials for writing to AWS S3.

### Health checks

CDCSDK Server exposes a simple health check REST API. Currently the health check only ensures that the server is up and running.

#### Running the health checks

The following REST endpoints are exposed:

* `/q/health/live` - The application is up and running.
* `/q/health/ready` - The application is ready to serve requests.

All of the health REST endpoints return a simple JSON object with two fields:
* `status`â€‰â€”â€‰The overall result of all the health check procedures.
* `checks`â€‰â€”â€‰An array of individual checks.

The general status of the health check is computed as a logical AND of all the declared health check procedures. In the following example, the checks array is empty as no health check procedure have been specified yet.


```output
curl http://localhost:8080/q/health/live

{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "debezium",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}

curl http://localhost:8080/q/health/ready

{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
    ]
}
```
