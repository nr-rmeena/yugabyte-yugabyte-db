{{< tip title="YugabyteDB Anywhere release notes have moved" >}}
The release notes for YugabyteDB Anywhere have moved here. The [YugabyteDB v2.16 release notes](../../release-notes/v2.16/) (and all other releases) are still available in their original location.
{{< /tip >}}

Included here are the release notes for all releases in the **YugabyteDB Anywhere** v2.16 series. Content will be added as new notable features and changes are available in the patch releases of the YBA v2.16  series.

For an RSS feed of all release series, point your feed reader to the [RSS feed for releases](../../index.xml).

{{< warning title="Use database version 2.16.1.1 or later" >}}
YugabyteDB releases in the v2.16 series prior to v2.16.1.1 contain a backup issue: if a database contains a pre-split range-partitioned table whose _primary key constraint column ordering_ isn't the same as the _table's column ordering_.

If you're using a previous v2.16 database version, you won't be able to successfully perform backups until you upgrade to YugabyteDB 2.16.1.1 or later.
