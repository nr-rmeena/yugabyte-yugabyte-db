{{< warning title="Use database version 2.16.1.1 or later" >}}
YugabyteDB releases in the v2.16 series prior to v2.16.1.1 contain a backup issue: if a database contains a pre-split range-partitioned table whose _primary key constraint column ordering_ isn't the same as the _table's column ordering_.

If you're using a previous v2.16 database version, you won't be able to successfully perform backups until you upgrade to YugabyteDB 2.16.1.1 or later.
