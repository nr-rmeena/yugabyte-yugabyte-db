### Highlights

### New features

* [Instant database cloning](/preview/manage/backup-restore/instant-db-cloning/) allows you to quickly create independent copies of your database for data recovery, development, and testing. Clones can be created in seconds, and initially consume no additional disk space because they share the same data files as the original database. Clones can be created as of now, or as of any time in the recent past (within a configurable history retention period), so developers can experiment without impacting production performance. Clones also provide a safety net for rapid recovery from accidental data loss or corruption. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [PostgreSQL extensions](/stable/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/)
  * [pg_cron extension support](/stable/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgcron/). pg_cron brings a cron-based job scheduler directly into the database. With pg_cron, you can schedule YSQL commands using familiar cron syntax, including jobs on intervals as fine as seconds. While pg_cron operates on a single node known as the pg_cron leader, the queries it schedules leverage the full resources of the distributed cluster. In case of node failure, leadership is automatically transferred, ensuring continuous availability and smooth scheduling operations. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

  * [pg_partman extension support](/preview/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgpartman/). Added native support for pg_partman extension to create and manage both time-based and serial-based table partition sets. pg_partman simplifies managing table partitions based on time or serial IDs, automating their creation and maintenance. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [Active Session History](/stable/explore/observability/active-session-history/). Get real-time and historical information about active sessions to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [yugabyted](/stable/reference/configuration/yugabyted/)
  * [xCluster support](/stable/reference/configuration/yugabyted/#set-up-xcluster-replication-between-clusters). yugabyted enables native support for setting up xCluster between two yugabyted deployed clusters.
  * [xCluster support for existing clusters](/stable/reference/configuration/yugabyted/#set-up-xcluster-replication-between-clusters) Enables ability to add or remove databases from the existing xCluster replication using yugabyted CLI. {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

* [Semi-automatic xCluster replication](/stable/deploy/multi-dc/async-replication/async-replication-transactional/). Semi-automatic xCluster replication simplifies the management of YSQL transactional xCluster replication by operating at the database level instead of the table level. This reduces the need for IT admin involvement when tables are created or dropped, as xCluster management is only required for adding or removing entire databases from replication. DDL operations can be performed by authorized users or DBAs without needing elevated privileges. Semi-automatic xCluster supports YSQL transactional replication and is ideal for Disaster Recovery (DR) purposes.

* [Colocated tables with tablespaces](/stable/explore/colocation/#colocated-tables-with-tablespaces). With the introduction of tablespaces support for colocated tables, you can assign tablespaces to their colocated tables, bridging the gap between regional data distribution and performance demands. This development eliminates the need for trade-offs, allowing organizations to adhere to compliance requirements while benefiting from the efficiency of colocated tables and relations. By ensuring all colocated tables in a tablespace reside in the same tablet, this feature optimizes both data management and operational efficiency. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* xCluster observability. Added ability for users to monitor xCluster metrics like Replication Lag, Safetime Lag, and replication errors, with support runbooks for troubleshooting via YB-Master/YB-TServer UIs, YugabyteDB Anywhere dashboards, and logs. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}
<!-- IDEA-1299. Unsure about docs -->

* [Follower reads](/stable/explore/going-beyond-sql/follower-reads-ysql/). Added ability to read from the follower after starting the transaction, but before the first statement is executed.

* [Query performance enhancement](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#pg-client-use-shared-memory). Implement shared memory for PostgreSQL to TServer communication to minimize latency and enhance query performance by reducing communication overhead.

* [Skip column updates](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#yb-skip-redundant-update-ops). Avoids updating columns which are included in any Index and Foreign key constraints when the columns values are not changed.

* Improvement to backward scans. Speed up YSQL backward scans by 10x-15x. For example, descending scans on tables that are stored in ascending order are now much faster. Previously, backward scans were significantly slower than forward scans in YugabyteDB, causing the query optimizer to implement various workarounds, including adding a sort operator on top of the forward scan operator to keep the backward scan pattern comparable. Such optimizer tricks might have been ineffective in complex query plans. The improvements to backward scan performance now allows such queries to be faster out of the box. You enable the feature using the `use_fast_backward_scan` preview flag. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}
<!-- No docs needed, customers would see the performance impact automatically. -->

* SELECT query performance. Enables the batching for locking the rows and thus helps improve the performance of the queries which lock more than 1 row using SELECT FOR UPDATE.
<!-- No docs needed-->

* Sequential scan speed. Improved ANALYZE and sequential scan performance by leveraging OS-level read-ahead, resulting in up to 8x faster ANALYZE operations.
<!-- IDEA-1878. Unsure about docs -->

* ALTER support. Added support for miscellanious ALTER TABLE DDLs.
<!-- DOC-528 pending -->

* Catalog caching. Provides ability to find catalog tables which can be preloaded to improve latency for first query in connection or after DDL in the cluster.{{<tags/feature/ea>}}
<!-- DOC-526, won't make it to 2024.2 -->

* CDC connector on Confluent Hub. YugabyteDB CDC Connector is now available in Confluent Hub. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}
<!-- No docs needed-->

* [Connection pooling](/stable/explore/going-beyond-sql/connection-mgr-ysql/) Added support for native connection pooling. {{<tags/feature/tp>}}
<!-- No docs given, linking to existing built-in connection manager-->
