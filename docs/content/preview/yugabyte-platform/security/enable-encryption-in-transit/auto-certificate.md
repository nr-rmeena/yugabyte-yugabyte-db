YugabyteDB Anywhere can automatically create and manage self-signed certificates for universes when you create them. These certificates may be shared between universes in a single instance of YugabyteDB Anywhere.

Automatically generated certificates are named using the following convention:

```sh
yb-environment-universe_name
```

where *environment* is the environment type (either `dev`, `stg`, `demo`, or `prod`) that was used during the tenant registration (admin user creation), and *universe_name* is the provided universe name.

YugabyteDB Anywhere generates the root certificate, root private key, and node-level certificates (assuming node-to-node encryption is enabled), and then provisions those artifacts to the database nodes any time nodes are created or added to the cluster. The following three files are copied to each node:

1. The root certificate (`ca.cert`).
1. The node certificate (`node.ip_address.crt`).
1. The node private key (`node.ip_address.key`).

YugabyteDB Anywhere retains the root certificate and the root private key for all interactions with the cluster.

To view the certificate details, navigate to **Configs > Security > Encryption in Transit** and click **Show details**.

### Customize the organization name in self-signed certificates

YugabyteDB Anywhere automatically creates self-signed certificates when you run some workflows, such as create universe. The organization name in certificates is set to `example.com` by default.

If you are using YugabyteDB Anywhere version 2.18.2 or later to manage universes with YugabyteDB version 2.18.2 or later, you can set a custom organization name using the global [runtime configuration](../../../administer-yugabyte-platform/manage-runtime-config/) flag, `yb.tlsCertificate.organizationName`.

Note that, for the change to take effect, you need to set the flag _before_ you run a workflow that generates a self-signed certificate.

Customize the organization name as follows:

1. In YugabyteDB Anywhere, navigate to **Admin** > **Advanced** and select the **Global Configuration** tab.
1. In the **Search** bar, enter `yb.tlsCertificate.organizationName` to view the flag, as per the following illustration:

    ![Custom Organization name](/images/yp/encryption-in-transit/custom-org-name.png)

1. Click **Actions** > **Edit Configuration**, enter a new Config Value, and click **Save**.

### Validate custom organization name

You can verify the organization name by running the following `openssl x509` command:

```sh
openssl x509 -in ca.crt -text
```

```output {hl_lines=[6]}
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 1683277970271 (0x187eb2f7b5f)
        Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN=yb-dev-sb-ybdemo-univ1~2, O=example.com
        Validity
            Not Before: May 5 09:12:50 2023 GMT
            Not After : May 5 09:12:50 2027 GMT
```

Notice that default value is `O=example.com`.

After setting the runtime configuration to a value of your choice, (`org-foo` in this example), you should see output similar to the following:

```sh
openssl x509 -in ca.crt -text -noout
```

```output
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 1689376612248 (0x18956b15f98)
        Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN = yb-dev-sb-ybdemo-univ1~2, O = org-foo
        Validity
            Not Before: Jul 14 23:16:52 2023 GMT
            Not After : Jul 14 23:16:52 2027 GMT
        Subject: CN = yb-dev-sb-ybdemo-univ1~2, O = org-foo
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (2048 bit)
                Modulus:
```

## Validate certificates

When configuring and using certificates, SSL issues may occasionally arise. You can validate your certificates and keys as follows:

- Verify that the CA CRT and CA private key match by executing the following commands:

    ```shell
    openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in ca.key | openssl md5
    openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in ca.crt | openssl md5

    \# outputs should match
    ```

- Verify that the CA CRT is actually a certificate authority by executing the following command:

    ```shell
    openssl x509 -text -noout -in ca.crt

    \# Look for fields

    X509v3 Basic Constraints:

      CA:TRUE
    ```

- Verify that certificates and keys are in PEM format (as opposed to the DER or other format). If these artifacts are not in the PEM format and you require assistance with converting them or identifying the format, consult [Converting certificates](https://support.globalsign.com/ssl/ssl-certificates-installation/converting-certificates-openssl).

- Ensure that the private key does not have a passphrase associated with it. For information on how to identify this condition, see [Decrypt an encrypted SSL RSA private key](https://techjourney.net/how-to-decrypt-an-enrypted-ssl-rsa-private-key-pem-key/).

## Enforce TLS versions

As TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer accepted by PCI compliance, and considering significant vulnerabilities around these versions of the protocol, it is recommended that you migrate to TLS 1.2 or later versions.

You can set the TLS version for node-to-node and client-node communication. To enforce TLS 1.2, add the following flag for YB-TServer:

```shell
ssl_protocols = tls12
```

To enforce the minimum TLS version of 1.2, you need to specify all available subsequent versions for YB-TServer, as follows:

```shell
ssl_protocols = tls12,tls13
```

In addition, as the `ssl_protocols` setting does not propagate to PostgreSQL, it is recommended that you specify the minimum TLS version (`ssl_min_protocol_version`) for PostgreSQL by setting the following YB-TServer flag:

```shell
--ysql_pg_conf_csv="ssl_min_protocol_version='TLSv1.2'"
```
