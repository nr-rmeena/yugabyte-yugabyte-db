When making DDL changes to databases in xCluster replication (such as creating, altering, or dropping tables or partitions), you must do the following:

- Make the change at the SQL level on both the source and target.
- Update the xCluster replication configuration in YugabyteDB Anywhere.

The order in which you do this varies depending on the operation.

## Order of operations

Perform DDL operations in the order as shown in the following table.

In addition, keep in mind the following:

- If you are using Colocated tables, you CREATE TABLE on target, then CREATE TABLE on source, making sure that you force the Colocation ID to be identical to that on target.
- If you try to make a DDL change on source and it fails, you must also make the same attempt on target and get the same failure.

Use the following guidance when managing tables and indexes in universes with replication configured.

## Tables

Note: If you are performing application upgrades involving both adding and dropping tables, perform the upgrade in two parts: first add tables, then drop tables.

### Add a table to replication

To ensure that data is protected at all times, set up replication on a new table _before_ starting any workload.

Before adding a table to replication in YugabyteDB Anywhere, refer to [Order of operations](#order-of-operations) for your setup.

Add tables to replication as follows:

1. Navigate to your source and select **xCluster Replication**.
1. Click **Actions** and choose **Select Databases and Tables**.
1. Select the tables and click **Validate Selection**.
1. If data needs to be copied, click **Next: Confirm Full Copy**.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.

Note the following:

- If the newly added table already has data, then adding the table can trigger a full copy of that entire database from source to target.

- It is recommended that you set up replication on the new table before starting any workload to ensure that data is protected at all times. This approach also avoids the full copy.

- This operation also automatically adds any associated index tables of this table to the replication configuration.

- If using colocation, colocated tables on the source and target should be created with the same colocation ID if they already exist on both the source and target prior to replication setup.

### Remove a table from replication

Before dropping a table, refer to [Order of operations](#order-of-operations) for your setup.

When dropping a table in version 2.23 or later, you don't need to perform any action in YugabyteDB Anywhere.

When dropping a table in versions ealier than 2.23, remove the table from replication before dropping the table in the source and target databases, as follows:

1. Navigate to your source and select **xCluster Replication**.
1. Click **Actions** and choose **Select Databases and Tables**.
1. Deselect the tables and click **Validate Selection**.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.

## Indexes

### Add an index to replication

Indexes are automatically added to replication in an atomic fashion after you create the indexes separately on source and target. You don't need to stop the writes on the source.

CREATE INDEX may kill some in-flight transactions. This is a temporary error. Retry any failed transactions.

Add indexes to replication in the following sequence:

1. Create an index on the source.

1. Wait for index backfill to finish.

1. Create the same index on the target.

1. Wait for index backfill to finish.

    For instructions on monitoring backfill, refer to [Create indexes and track the progress](../../../../explore/ysql-language-features/indexes-constraints/index-backfill/).

1. [Reconcile the configuration](#reconcile-configuration).

### Remove an index from replication

When an index is dropped it is automatically removed from replication.

Remove indexes from replication in the following sequence:

1. Drop the index on the target.

1. Drop the index on the source.

1. [Reconcile the configuration](#reconcile-configuration).

## Table partitions

### Add a table partition to replication

Adding a table partition is similar to adding a table.

The caveat is that the parent table (if not already) along with each new partition has to be added to replication, as DDL changes are not replicated automatically. Each partition is treated as a separate table and is added to replication separately (like a table).

For example, you can create a table with partitions as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_changes (
  order_id int,
  change_date date,
  type text,
  description text)
  PARTITION BY RANGE (change_date);  
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_changes_default PARTITION OF order_changes DEFAULT;
```

Create a new partition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_changes_2023_01 PARTITION OF order_changes
FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2023-03-30');
```

Assume the parent table and default partition are included in the replication stream.

To add a table partition to replication, follow the same steps for [Add a table to replication](#add-a-table-to-replication).

### Remove table partitions from replication

To remove a table partition from replication, follow the same steps as [Remove a table from replication](#remove-a-table-from-replication).

## Reconcile configuration

To ensure changes made outside of YugabyteDB Anywhere are reflected in YugabyteDB Anywhere, you need to reconcile the configuration as follows:

1. In YugabyteDB Anywhere, navigate to your source and select **xCluster Replication**.
1. Click **Actions > Advanced** and choose **Reconcile Config with Database**.
