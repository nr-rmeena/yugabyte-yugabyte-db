Backup and Recovery is the process of creating and storing copies of the data that can be used for protection against data loss. By setting up a proper data backup strategy, you make sure you can always restore to a most recent known working state and minimize application downtimes, which in turn guarantees business and application continuity.

Note that unlike traditional single-instance databases, YugabyteDB is designed for fault tolerance. By maintaining at least three copies of the data across multiple data regions or multiple clouds, it makes sure no losses occur in case a single node or a single data region becomes unavailable. Thus, with YugabyteDB, backups are mainly used to:
1. Recover from a user or software error, e.g. accidental table removal.
2. Recover from a severe disaster scenario, like a full cluster failure or a simultaneous outage of multiple data regions (probability of such scenarios is extremely low, but itâ€™s still recommended to maintain a way to recover from them).
3. Maintain a remote copy of the data as required by data protection regulations.
