## Tabs using readfile

### Tabpane-1

This section uses the `readfile` shortcode to insert the contents of `/static/markdown-snippets/tabpane-1.md`, which contains just a `tabpane` shortcode.

{{< readfile "/static/markdown-snippets/tabpane-1.md" >}}

### Tabpane-2

This one does the same, using `/static/markdown-snippets/tabpane-2.md`.

{{< readfile "/static/markdown-snippets/tabpane-2.md" >}}
