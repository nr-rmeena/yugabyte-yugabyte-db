{{< note title="YugaPlus - The Story Begins" >}}
The first version of the YugaPlus streaming service was set for its prime time debut. The plan involved initially launching the service for users on the US West Coast, followed by a gradual rollout to users nationwide.

The launch was successful, with the first user signing up for YugaPlus to enjoy their favorite movies on demand. The service, powered by PostgreSQL, handled the incoming traffic with ease.

In this chapter, you'll learn to deploy one of the YugaPlus services - the movie recommendations service that takes user questions in plain English and uses an underlying generative AI stack (OpenAI, Spring AI and PostgreSQL pgvector) to provide the user with the most relevant movies recommendations.

You'll learn the following:

* How to deploy PostgreSQL with pgvector in Docker.
* How to perform vector similarity searches with pgvector and the OpenAI Embedding model.

**Prerequisites**

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) 20 or later.
* An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview). Without the API key, the application will perform full-text searches over the movie catalog instead of vector similarity searches. Note that the full-text search version is much less advanced.

{{< header Level="2" >}}Start PostgreSQL With pgvector{{< /header >}}

The pgvector extension transforms PostgreSQL into a vector database capable of storing and accessing vectorized data. The movie recommendations service utilizes pgvector to provide users with highly relevant recommendations based on their input.

Follow these steps to start a PostgreSQL instance with pgvector and enable the extension:

1. Create a directory to serve as the volume for the PostgreSQL container:

    ```shell
    mkdir ~/postgres-volume
    ```

2. Create a custom Docker network that will be used by PostgreSQL and other containers throughout this tutorial:

    ```shell
    docker network create yugaplus-network
    ```

3. Start a PostgreSQL container using the latest version of the image with pgvector:

    ```shell
    docker run --name postgres --net yugaplus-network \
        -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
        -p 5432:5432 \
        -v ~/postgresql-volume/:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
        -d ankane/pgvector:latest
    ```

4. Check the logs to ensure the container is up and running and PostgreSQL has initialized successfully:

    ```shell
    docker container ls -f name=postgres
    ```

5. Connect to the container and enable the pgvector extension:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it postgres-pgvector psql -U postgres -c 'CREATE EXTENSION vector'
    ```

With the database operational, you're now ready to deploy the first version of YugaPlus on your machine!

{{< header Level="2" >}}Deploy YugaPlus Movie Recommendations Service{{< /header >}}

The service consists of a React frontend and a Java backend. You don't need prior knowledge of React or Java, nor do you have to install any language-specific toolchains. Both the frontend and backend are deployed in Docker, which automatically pulls all required libraries and frameworks.

**Prepare for the deployment:**

1. Clone the YugaPlus repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/YugabyteDB-Samples/YugaPlus.git .
    ```

2. Create an OpenAI API key: <https://platform.openai.com>

{{< tip title="Free Tier">}}
At the time of writing, OpenAI offered a generous free tier, which was more than sufficient to complete this tutorial.
{{< /tip >}}

**Start the backend:**

1. Navigate to the backend directory of the project:

    ```shell
    cd {yugaplus-dir}/backend
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:

    ```shell
    docker build -t yugaplus-backend .
    ```

3. Start a backend container using your `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

    ```shell
    docker run --name yugaplus-backend --net yugaplus-network -p 8080:8080 \
        -e DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/postgres \
        -e DB_USER=postgres \
        -e DB_PASSWORD=password \
        -e OPENAI_API_KEY=${YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY} \
        yugaplus-backend
    ```

The backend connects to the PostgreSQL container, initializes the movies catalog, and pre-loads a sample dataset with over 2,800 movies. This dataset includes embeddings pre-generated for movie overviews using the OpenAI Embedding model (`text-embedding-ada-002`). Upon successful startup, the backend will display the following messages in the terminal window:

```output
INFO 1 --- [main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path ''
INFO 1 --- [main] c.y.backend.YugaPlusBackendApplication   : Started YugaPlusBackendApplication in 18.681 seconds (process running for 19.173)
```

**Start the frontend:**

1. Open another terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory of the project:

    ```shell
    cd {yugaplus-dir}/frontend
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:

    ```shell
    docker build -t yugaplus-frontend . 
    ```

3. Deploy a frontend container:

    ```shell
    docker run --name yugaplus-frontend --net yugaplus-network -p 3000:3000 \
        -e REACT_APP_PROXY_URL=http://yugaplus-backend:8080 \
        yugaplus-frontend
    ```

The frontend container starts in a few seconds and is accessible at the following address: <http://localhost:3000/>

{{< header Level="2" >}}Search For Your Favorite Movies{{< /header >}}

Once logged in, you'll arrive at the YugaPlus home page, which is divided into two sections. The **Your Movies** section displays your user library, featuring movies you are currently watching or plan to watch soon. The **Search New Movies** section helps you discover new content by asking for recommendations in plain English.

![YugaPlus Home Screen](/images/tutorials/build-and-learn/chapter1-home-screen.png)

Internally, the service uses the following database schema:

![YugaPlus Home Screen](/images/tutorials/build-and-learn/yugaplus-schema.png)

* `movie` - the table stores information about movies available on YugaPlus. The `overview_vector` column contains 1536-dimensional vectors generated using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model, based on the movies' descriptions in the `overview` column.
* `user_account` - the table with uses-specific details.
* `user_library` - this table records the movies that users add to their libraries.

Next, go ahead and ask YugaPlus to suggest a few movies for your upcoming evening watch by typing in the following prompt:

<ul class="nav nav-tabs-alt nav-tabs-yb">
  <li >
    <a href="#similarity-search" class="nav-link active" id="similarity-search-tab" data-toggle="tab"
       role="tab" aria-controls="similarity-search" aria-selected="true">
      <i class="fa-brands fa-apple" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      Similarity Search (OpenAI)
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#full-text-search" class="nav-link" id="full-text-search-tab" data-toggle="tab"
       role="tab" aria-controls="full-text-search" aria-selected="false">
      <i class="fa-brands fa-linux" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      Full-text search
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="tab-content">
  <div id="similarity-search" class="tab-pane fade show active" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="similarity-search-tab">
  {{% includeMarkdown "includes/chapter1-similarity-search.md" %}}
  </div>
  <div id="full-text-search" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="full-text-search-tab">
  {{% includeMarkdown "includes/chapter1-full-text-search.md" %}}
  </div>
</div>

Congratulations, you've completed Chapter 1! You have successfully deployed the first version of the YugaPlus movie recommendations service and got it operational on a PostgreSQL instance with the pgvector extension.
