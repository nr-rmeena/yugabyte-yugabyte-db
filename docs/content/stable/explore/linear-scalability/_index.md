Depending on your business, you may find you need to scale for a variety of reasons:

- **Growing user base**. Your application becomes popular, users love your app, and the user base is expanding.
- **Seasonal traffic**. Occasionally, you have to handle a lot more transactions per second than usual. Black Friday and Cyber Monday retail traffic, or streaming for special events like the Superbowl or World Cup, for example.
- **Growing datasets**. For example, you have an IoT app or an audit database that keeps growing rapidly daily. These systems have to handle a high volume of writes regularly.
- **Changing business priorities**. Scaling needs are often unpredictable. To take one example, retail priorities shifted radically when Covid entered the picture. With a database that can scale, you can pivot quickly when the business environment shifts.
- **New geographies**. Your user base expands to new regions, and you need to add to your presence globally by adding more data centers in different continents.

Being able to scale seamlessly is as important as being able to scale. Scaling needs to be operationally simple and completely transparent to the applications. With YugabyteDB, you can start small and add nodes as needed. You can scale your data, reads, and writes without disrupting ongoing applications. As your needs grow, YugabyteDB automatically shards data and scales out. You can also scale up your cluster for short-term needs and then scale down after the need is over.

## Ways to scale

There are 2 common ways to scale, namely **vertical** and **horizontal**. YugabyteDB supports both. Because YugabyteDB is distributed, scaling is operationally straightforward and performed without any service disruption.

| Scaling&nbsp;Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Vertical<br>(scale up) | This is the standard way to scale traditional databases. It involves upgrading the existing hardware or resources of each of the nodes in your cluster. Instead of adding more machines, you enhance the capabilities of a single machine by increasing its CPU, memory, storage, and so on.<br><br>Vertical scaling is often limited by the capacity of a single server and can get expensive as you move to more powerful hardware. Although you retain the same number of nodes, which could simplify your operations, eventually hardware resources reach their limits, and further scaling might not be feasible. In addition, all the data has to be moved, which can take time. |
| Horizontal<br>(scale out) | You [add more nodes](./node-addition/) to a distributed database to handle increased load and data. This is the most common scaling model in YugabyteDB, and has several advantages, including:<br><ul><li>Improved performance - More nodes can process requests in parallel, reducing response times. [Reads](./scaling-reads/), [writes](./scaling-writes/), and [transactions](./scaling-transactions/) scale linearly as you add nodes.</li><li>Cost-effective - You can use commodity hardware, which is generally less expensive than high-end servers.</li><li>Elastic - You can add new nodes as needed to handle high traffic for special events, and, when traffic returns to typical levels, scale back in by draining all the data from some nodes (or Kubernetes pods) and removing them from the cluster.</li><li>No limits - There's no practical limit to the number of servers you can add.</li><li>Less disruptive - You don't need to move your application, and only need to move a portion of your data when you add a node.</li></ul>Horizontal scaling is also the most practical way to expand to new regions. |

Depending on your application needs and budget constraints, you can use a combination of both horizontal and vertical scaling to achieve the desired performance and scalability goals. The following table lists the pros and cons of horizontal and vertical scaling of a YugabyteDB cluster.

| **Ease of effort**      | Add new nodes to the cluster                                                      | Add more powerful nodes, drain the old nodes, and remove them from the cluster           |
| **Fault tolerance**     | Increases as more nodes are added                                           | Remains the same                                                                        |
| **Cluster&nbsp;rebalancing** | Faster                                                                            | Slower                                                                                  |
| **Future scaling**      | More nodes can be always be added                                                      | Limited to the most powerful machines available currently                                   |
| **Cost**                | Cost of newer machines                                                            | Difference in cost between the new and old machines                                          |
| **Disk**                | Same disks as other nodes can be used as data and connections will be distributed | Along with CPU and memory, disks should also be upgraded to handle increased workloads |

## How scaling works

Adding more nodes to a system seamlessly is the foundation of scalability. It is important to understand what happens inside YugabyteDB to get an idea of the effort and estimate the timeline needed to scale your systems. There are a few basic concepts that enable YugabyteDB to scale. Let's go over them quickly.

### Sharding

Data distribution is critical in scaling. In YugabyteDB, data is [split (sharded)](./data-distribution/) into tablets. A tablet is effectively a piece of a table and these tablets are placed on various nodes. The mapping of a row of a table to a tablet is deterministic and the system knows exactly which tablet holds a specific row.

To learn more about the different types of sharding, see [Hash & Range sharding](../../architecture/docdb-sharding/sharding/). For an illustration of how tablets are split, see [Tablet splitting](./data-distribution/#tablet-splitting)
{{</tip>}}

### Rebalancing

As your data grows, tablets are split and moved across the different nodes in the cluster to maintain an equal distribution of data across the nodes. This process is known as _Rebalancing_. Data is moved automatically, without any interruption in service.

For an illustration of how tablets are rebalanced, see [Rebalancing](./data-distribution/#rebalancing)
{{</tip>}}

### Adding nodes

When more [nodes are added](./node-addition), some tablets are automatically [rebalanced](./data-distribution/#rebalancing) to the new nodes, and the entire cluster can therefore handle more transactions and queries in parallel, thus increasing its capacity to handle larger workloads.

## When to scale

To know when to scale, monitor metrics provided for CPU, memory, and disk space. Set up alerts on these metrics to give you ample time to plan and react.

For best results, keep steady state resource usage under 60%, and take strong action at 75%, in particular for disk space. If CPU or memory is high, the system will slow; if disk usage approaches limits, usage on followers also increases, and moving and recovering data takes time.

[YugabyteDB Anywhere](../../yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/) and [YugabyteDB Managed](../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-monitor/) both include metrics dashboards and configurable alerts to keep you notified of changes.
